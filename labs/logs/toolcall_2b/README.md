# agent-trace tool-call eval — suite, runner, scorer

This directory implements the pre-registered plan at
`claudius-maximus/state/reports/2026-09-06-TOOLCALL-EVAL-PLAN.md` (sections
2-5): a 60-item deterministic suite of CALC/LOOKUP tool-call prompts, a
runner that turns each item into one AEGIS-TRACE receipt (`gen` then
`verify`, same mechanism as `demo/agent-trace/run.sh`), and a scorer that
reports Wilson-interval rates per the plan's metrics.

**Nothing is measured yet.** This directory is the harness, committed before
any run. `suite.tsv` and `smoke.tsv` are generated files (see below); no
receipts, summaries, or rate numbers are checked in.

## Files

- `gen_suite.py` — deterministic item generator (stdlib only, seed
  `20260906`). Writes `suite.tsv` (60 items) and `smoke.tsv` (10 items: 2
  each from the 5 largest buckets). Re-run any time; output is
  byte-identical run to run. `--bucket chain --table <path> --out <path>`
  writes only the 6-item "chain" bucket (see 'Chain items' below) to its own
  file instead of touching `suite.tsv`/`smoke.tsv`.
- `suite.tsv` / `smoke.tsv` — generated TSVs, header:
  `item_id bucket prompt_template_id prompt_text expected_tool expected_input expected_output notes`.
  `prompt_text` newlines are escaped as the two-byte sequence `\n` (backslash-n)
  because TSV rows are one-per-line; `run_suite.sh` reverses this escaping
  before writing the prompt to a file for `gen`.
- `test_calc_semantics.py` — stdlib `unittest` checking the suite's Python
  CALC implementation against the Rust tool's vectors.
- `run_suite.sh` — runs one TSV of items through `agent_trace gen` +
  `agent_trace verify`, writes `<outdir>/summary.tsv`, `<outdir>/RUN.txt`,
  `<outdir>/timing.tsv`, and per-item receipts/prompts. Resumable.
- `score.py` — reads a `summary.tsv` and prints per-bucket / overall rates
- `check_verbatim.py` — receipt-only detector for shot-copied or key-snapped
  tool arguments (step-0 argument must appear verbatim in the last `Q:` line
  of the receipt's own prompt); `test_check_verbatim.py` is its unittest
  with Wilson 95% intervals, plus the plan's pre-registered red flags.

## Generating the suite

```
cd demo/agent-trace/eval
python3 gen_suite.py
```

Prints the sha256 of `suite.tsv` and `smoke.tsv`. Run twice to confirm
byte-identical output (the script does not depend on anything but stdlib
`random.Random(20260906)` and a fixed generation order).

## Running the smoke suite

Uses the same artifact-path convention as `demo/agent-trace/run.sh`
(`AEGIS_ARTIFACTS=<dir>` with `MODEL.SAF`/`EMBED.BIN`/`VOCAB.BIN` inside it,
or the three `AEGIS_MODEL`/`AEGIS_EMBED`/`AEGIS_VOCAB` env vars individually).

In-repo M7 tinybit model (never emits a tool call within N=24 tokens — that
is expected and fine for a mechanism smoke test, not a rate measurement):

```
AGENT_TRACE_BIN=/path/to/aegis-linux/target/release/examples/agent_trace \
  ./run_suite.sh smoke.tsv /tmp/eval-smoke-m7
```

2B artifacts (note: the 2B artifact directory does NOT follow the
`MODEL.SAF`/`EMBED.BIN`/`VOCAB.BIN` naming `AEGIS_ARTIFACTS` expects — its
files are named `aegis_pruned_model.cis.safetensors`, `embed.bin`,
`vocab.bin` — so override the three individual variables, not
`AEGIS_ARTIFACTS`):

```
AEGIS_MODEL=~/aefinity-artifacts/bitnet2b-2b-artifacts/aegis_pruned_model.cis.safetensors \
AEGIS_EMBED=~/aefinity-artifacts/bitnet2b-2b-artifacts/embed.bin \
AEGIS_VOCAB=~/aefinity-artifacts/bitnet2b-2b-artifacts/vocab.bin \
AGENT_TRACE_BIN=/path/to/aegis-linux/target/release/examples/agent_trace \
  ./run_suite.sh smoke.tsv /tmp/eval-smoke-2b
```

`--template T3` runs the unclosed-`CALC(` ablation instead of the default T1
prompts: the item's prompt is rewritten to end with an unclosed `CALC(` (or
`LOOKUP(` for a table item) opener instead of a fully-formed call, so the
model only has to transcribe the arguments and closing paren. The
`agent_trace` scanner recognizes this: when a step's running prompt (trailing
whitespace trimmed) itself ends with `CALC(` or `LOOKUP(`, that opener is
carried as a scan prefix over the step's newly decoded text, so a
continuation like `758 + 927).` still closes and scores the call natively
(no shot-copied-argument workaround needed). A prompt with no trailing
opener scans exactly as before. `--limit N` caps how many not-yet-done items
are run this invocation (the run is resumable — items already in
`summary.tsv` are skipped on a re-run).

## Optional per-item TPM attestation (`--attest`)

```
./run_suite.sh smoke.tsv /tmp/eval-smoke --attest
```

With `--attest`, after each item's receipt is generated and verified, the
runner also calls `demo/agent-trace/run.sh attest <receipt> <outdir>/attest/<item_id>`
— the same TPM-quote mechanism used by the single-episode demo (see
`demo/edge-receipt/attest.sh`). Per `attest.sh`'s own doc comment, the quote's
qualifying data (nonce) is the item's **full** `trace-chain` receipt digest
(all 64 hex chars / 32 bytes), not a truncated prefix, so the quote binds the
entire receipt, not just part of it.

What is recorded:

- `<outdir>/attest/<item_id>/` — one directory per item, holding whatever
  `attest.sh quote` writes there (`ATTEST.txt`, `ak.pem`, `quote.msg`,
  `quote.sig`, `quote.pcrs`, etc — see `demo/edge-receipt/README.md`/
  `attest.sh` for the field list).
- `<outdir>/receipts/<item_id>.attest.out` / `.attest.err` — the `run.sh
  attest` call's stdout/stderr for that item.
- `<outdir>/attest.tsv` — `item_id`, `attest_rc` for every attested item
  (`attest_rc` is `0` on success, a nonzero exit code on failure, or `skip`
  if the item had no receipt to attest because `gen` itself failed).
- `<outdir>/summary.tsv` gains an eleventh `attest_rc` column, holding the
  same value as `attest.tsv` for that item — added **only** when `--attest`
  is given; without the flag `summary.tsv`'s ten-column layout (and
  `RUN.txt`/`timing.tsv`) is unchanged from a run without this option, so
  `score.py` (which reads columns by name) keeps working either way.
- `<outdir>/RUN.txt` gains three lines, written/refreshed once the whole
  run's items have been processed (safe to run this more than once against
  the same `<outdir>`, e.g. on a resumed run):
  `attest-requested yes`, `attest-count N` (items attested, `skip`s
  included), `attest-fail M` (items whose `attest_rc` was neither `0` nor
  absent — i.e. a nonzero exit code; `skip` counts as a fail here since no
  attestation was produced). These three lines are never written when
  `--attest` is not given.

Resuming into an outdir whose `summary.tsv` was already started with a
different `--attest` setting (10-column file but `--attest` given now, or
vice versa) is refused: `run_suite.sh` compares the existing header against
the one this invocation would use, and exits 2 with a one-line message
naming the outdir and both headers, before touching anything in `<outdir>`.

An attest failure (missing TPM, `attest.sh` erroring, etc) is independent of
`agent_trace verify` and never changes an item's `verify_result` column —
attestation is an optional, additional check layered on top of a receipt
that already verified (or didn't) on its own.

## Scoring

```
python3 score.py /tmp/eval-smoke-m7/summary.tsv
```

Works on a partial `summary.tsv` (fewer rows than the suite/smoke file).

## Verbatim-argument check (receipt-only)

```
python3 check_verbatim.py /tmp/eval-smoke-m7/receipts /tmp/eval-smoke-m7/summary.tsv
```

Flags every receipt whose step-0 tool argument is not a verbatim substring of
the last `Q:` line of the receipt's prompt. It reads nothing but the receipt,
so a verifier can apply it without the suite or the model. On EVAL-60 T1 (2B,
2026-09-06) it flagged the three lookup near-miss items where the model snapped
the key to a real one (`p-100` -> `LOOKUP(P-100)`, `Q-205` -> `LOOKUP(P-205)`,
`part.local` -> `LOOKUP(P-100)`) and the distractor it answered by copying a
shot (`two + two` -> `CALC(2 + 2)`), with zero false positives on the 47
correct calls. It is a report, not a gate: exit status is always 0.

Known gap: only step 0 is checked. K>1 receipts record the initial prompt
only, so a step-1 argument copied from a shot (EVAL-60 T1 `mixed_02`) is not
visible to this rule until the receipt carries per-step queries.

## Chain items

The "mixed" bucket's second step is never forced (see the deviation below)
and, when it does fire, its content is fully determined by a few-shot
example already sitting in the *initial* prompt — so a step-2 argument that
matches is not distinguishable from the model having copied a shot. The
"chain" bucket exists to give `agent_trace`'s per-step verbatim rule
(`verbatim_ok_for` in `aegis-linux/examples/agent_trace.rs`) a genuine
positive case: a step-2 argument that can *only* have come from external
text appended after step 1 ran, never from the initial prompt.

Each of the 6 `chain_01`..`chain_06` items' initial prompt few-shots two
LOOKUPs on keys (`P-402`, `P-403`) that are never a chain target or a
superseded key, then asks about one "superseded" row (`P-901`..`P-906`,
added in `demo/agent-trace/tables/chain.tsv`) whose value text is exactly
`Superseded, see part <real key>`. After `agent_trace` runs the step-1
LOOKUP, it appends `\nTOOL[lookup]=Superseded, see part <real key>\n` to the
running prompt and keeps decoding (see `tool_result_text`) — so the *only*
place the real key appears, for the rest of the episode, is that appended
tool-result text. If the model's step-2 LOOKUP names that key, its argument
is verbatim-traceable to a prior tool result, not a prompt shot — the
positive case the WARNING-only verbatim rule is meant to distinguish from a
shot-copy or key-snap.

`chain.tsv` is `demo.tsv`'s 10 rows unchanged, plus the 6 `P-90x` rows
above — a **different file with a different sha256** from `demo.tsv`. Since
`run_suite.sh --suite-sha256`/`--table` fold the table's own sha256 into
every receipt's trace genesis, a receipt generated against `chain.tsv`
cannot verify against `demo.tsv` (or vice versa) even for the same key —
chain-run receipts and demo-run receipts are not interchangeable.

Chain items are **not** part of the default 60-item `suite.tsv`/`smoke.tsv`
(`gen_suite.py`'s default invocation is unchanged and still produces
byte-identical output) — generate and run them separately:

```
python3 gen_suite.py --bucket chain --table ../tables/chain.tsv --out chain.tsv
./run_suite.sh chain.tsv /tmp/eval-chain --table ../tables/chain.tsv --bin /path/to/agent_trace
python3 score.py /tmp/eval-chain/summary.tsv
```

`score.py` scores "chain" exactly like "mixed": both are K=2 buckets whose
`tool_expected`/`tool_observed`/`arg_match`/`output_match` are comma-joined
step-1,step-2 values (see 'Caveat: comma-joined fields' below); `score.py`
itself is bucket-name-agnostic, so it needs no chain-specific code.

## Deviations from the plan (logged, not silent)

- **`//` operator does not exist.** Plan section 2 lists CALC hard-bucket
  ops as `+ - * //`. `agent_trace.rs`'s `find_calc` grammar only supports
  `+ - * / %` (see its module doc comment and `eval_calc`). `gen_suite.py`
  uses `/` (truncating toward zero, matching `i64::checked_div`) and `%`
  (remainder with the sign of the dividend, matching `i64::checked_rem`)
  instead of the plan's non-existent `//`.
- **Suite-hash folding into the receipt — DONE.** Plan section 5 noted that
  folding the eval item-suite's own sha256 into the cryptographic trace
  chain (the way `table-sha256` is folded for LOOKUP items) "if... turns
  out to need a code change, that change is a NEEDS item for alice-aegis,
  not something done inside this plan." That code change has since landed:
  `agent_trace gen`/`verify` accept an optional `--suite-sha256 <64hex>`
  that folds the given 32 bytes into the trace genesis after the table
  slot, under its own domain tag (the pre-existing table fold is
  byte-for-byte unchanged, so archived table-bound receipts keep
  verifying) and records
  a `suite-sha256 <64hex>` receipt header. `run_suite.sh` passes
  `--suite-sha256 $(sha256sum "$ITEMS")` to every `gen` and `verify` call,
  so every receipt this harness produces now binds the suite file's hash
  into its own cryptographic chain — a receipt generated under a different
  suite file will not verify unless the same hash is supplied or embedded,
  for CALC-only items as well as LOOKUP items. `RUN.txt`'s `suite-sha256`
  line remains as the human-readable out-of-band record.
- **Mixed-item (K=2) column conventions.** The plan's summary/suite TSV
  formats do not define how a 2-step mixed item's `expected_tool`/
  `tool_observed`/`arg_match`/`output_match` should represent two steps in
  one row. This harness comma-joins step-1,step-2 values (e.g.
  `expected_tool` = `CALC,LOOKUP`) in both `suite.tsv` and `run_suite.sh`'s
  `summary.tsv`. `arg_match`/`output_match` are single booleans (true only
  if *both* steps match); a finer per-step breakdown was judged unnecessary
  for a 3-item bucket.
- **Mixed items' second step is not forced.** `replay_episode` (the shared
  gen/verify core) only lets the model's own continuation, plus the fixed
  `TOOL[<name>]=<output>` text `agent_trace.rs` appends after step 1,
  determine what step 2 sees. This harness cannot and does not force the
  model into asking the second (LOOKUP or CALC) question — it primes both a
  CALC and a LOOKUP few-shot example in the initial prompt and reports
  whatever step 2 actually does. A mixed item where step 2 never asks the
  intended second question is a legitimate model-behavior finding, not a
  suite bug.
- **`well-formed rate` operationalization in `score.py`.** The plan defines
  well-formed as "fraction of emitted calls that parse under the existing
  scanner grammar... without the malformed/ambiguous failure modes already
  fixed in review." This harness has no independent access to the model's
  raw un-scanned decode text (only the receipt's already-scanned
  `tool=`/`in=`/`out=` fields), so `score.py` treats "well-formed" as
  "the scanner recognized *some* call" (`tool_observed` != `NONE` for a
  tool-expected item) — a proxy for the scanner's own accept decision, not
  a re-implementation of the grammar. `calc-error` (parsed but a
  runtime `div-by-zero`/`overflow`) counts as well-formed and as the
  correct tool, but not necessarily correct-argument/output (those still
  compare literal strings).

## What `RUN.txt` records

One header written once per `<outdir>`, before the first item: the suite
file's path and sha256, the table file's path and sha256, the three
artifact file sha256s, the `agent_trace` binary's sha256, `N`, the
`--template` in effect, `hostname`, and a UTC start timestamp. This is
provenance for the run as a whole; per-item reproducibility comes from each
item's own receipt file plus `agent_trace verify`, independent of this
report's summary numbers (plan section 5).

## Caveat: comma-joined fields

For mixed (K=2) items the `expected_tool`, `expected_input`, `expected_output`
columns in the suite and the `tool_observed`, `arg_match`, `output_match`
columns in `summary.tsv` are the two steps' values joined with a comma. Table
values themselves may contain commas, so these fields are compared as whole
strings and must not be split on `,` by any future consumer.
